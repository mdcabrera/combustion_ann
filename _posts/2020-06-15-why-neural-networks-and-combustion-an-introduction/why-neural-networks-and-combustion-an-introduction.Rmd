# Abstract:

The main objective of the work presented here is to research the current trends and advances
in the use of Artificial Neural Networks for the simulation of turbulent reactive flows using
Computational Fluid Dynamics in order to design, train and implement an efficient network capable
of predicting the chemical reaction source terms needed for solving the Navier-Stokes
equations for a turbulent reactive flow. Unlike non-reacting flows, this type of simulations need to
be coupled with a combustion model, whose order of accuracy is linked with an increase in
complexity. Here, the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) is chosen as a combustion model, since it
offers an acceptable balance between accuracy and computational cost. Unfortunately, even at its
most optimal, this modeling of the turbulence-chemistry interaction remains still to cost-prohibitive
for but not the simplest of problems, as the current implementations for dealing with the resulting
system of ordinary differential equations incur on either large CPU or memory requirements. It is
hoped that once the source terms produced by the neural network are combined with a combustion
simulation based on the Eddy Dissipation Concept a decrease in computational resources is
achieved while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. A training data has to also be
generated, as well an experiment procedure, to test different combinations of parameters and
validate results.

## 1. Problem Description:

Although computational resources are still increasing, and more and more simulations are
enabled, the computational time can still be prohibitive for reactive flow simulations using complex
kinetic mechanisms. As the number of species in a reaction increases, so does the number of
equations that must be solved. For example, GRI-Mech 3.0 an optimized mechanism designed to
model natural gas combustion, developed by the University of California, Berkeley involves 53
species and 325 elementary reactions[@Smith]. Current hardware developments make this situation
unlikely to change in the near future, since processors are approaching the point where heat
dissipation will cripple the increase in operational speed, and even in the face of increasing
parallelization of algorithms, memory speed will likely continue being a huge bottleneck in
computation speed.

The simulation of turbulent flows requires resolving the Navier Stokes Equations (NSE)
over a very wide range of time and length scales. When coupled with chemistry kinetics, generally,
the simulation of turbulent combustion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is
undertaken by one of the following three approaches [@Bao2017] : Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes
(RANS) equations, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) .
However DNS is as of now, computationally prohibitive even for non-reacting flows, and despite
the fact that LES and RANS are able to reduce computational cost by ignoring the smallest length
scales [@Deardorff1970] (via a low-pass filtering of the NSE) and by solving for the mean values among all
quantities, -respectively-, the representation of chemical kinetics is still a problem for all of them.

This representation requires precise information on the time rate of change of all species
involved in the reaction. To compute all these changes in species composition, an ODE system must
be solved. Taking the example from before, solving the 53 necessary conservation equations, as
well as the 325 reactions, might not be possible in a reasonable time. Adds to this issue, the fact that
this kind of reactions more often than not have to deal with species with different time reaction
rates, which will then thus make the system stiff [@Sen2009], further straining the available computational
resources by reducing the allowable time integration step.

To couple the chemistry and turbulence mechanisms the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC)
proposed -and late improved- by Magnussen ([@Magnussen2005], [@Magnussen1981] will be used. This model attempts to
incorporate the significance of fine structures in a turbulent reacting flow in which combustion is
important. In order to solve the time evolution of the different species at the fine scale level, the
EDC model uses either in-situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) or direct integration (DI) which are
burdened by large memory and CPU requirements respectively. According to Christo [@Christo1996], an
optimal numerical scheme for the chemistry representation must offer the advantage of the
aforementioned method, at low CPU and memory cost.

There are many different strategies to overcome this problem. Tabulation can be used, or the
mechanisms can be reduced to skeletal, i.e. simpler, mechanisms. Another way is to use Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN) trained by kinetic data and use it to predict the concentration changes in
combustion simulations. A lot of research is currently be done on CFD fields using this Machine
Learning technique. Among these approaches are included among others, using ANN to find more
efficient discretizations, and, as mentioned before, predict solutions of a given model.

ANN have proven effective in solving many engineering problems, and though still not fully
understood, there a proven mathematical results that back up their power for approximating any -
at least continuous- function (under certain assumptions) . These results include the Kolmogorov-
Arnold[@Khesin2014] representation theorem, and the Universal Approximation theorem [@Cybenko1989]. However, though
powerful, the proofs given for these theorems are not constructive, and thus don’t offer any
algorithm to build an efficient network, and of utmost importance, no explicit estimates are
provided for the number of units in a hidden layer[@Lye2020]. Very recent developments [@Chen2018] -from the last
two years, and thus to be taken cautiously- even give optimistic approaches on how to solve one its
may drawbacks: choosing the number of neurons and hidden layers (for which basically infinite
possibilities exist) by modeling this problem as a Differential Equation and using extant numerical
methods to approximate these parameters as a result.

Since, the main performance limiting factor when modeling turbulent reactive flows is
related to the computational effort used in solving the chemical reactions between all the involved
species, a proposed plan of action is to devise an ANN capable of approximating the chemical
reactions reliably, so as to couple it later with traditional non reactive flows, where the NSE are
solved with a common model modeling technique (RANS/LES).

Research on ANNs currently used in CFD, especially in reactive flow simulations should be
studied. An ANN shall be trained and tested for a chemical mechanism for methane combustion.
The application of the ANN for CFD simulations of flames should be possible in the end.

## 4. State of the Art:

* Porumbel et al. [@Porumbel2014] reported considerable speed-ups and acceptable accuracy of a 5-layer
Tanh ANN over DI and ISAT when dealing with a 16 species, methane reaction mechanism
with an integration time-step of 2e-7 coupled with a LES simulation of a Laminar 1-D
premixed methane flame and a turbulent 3-D methane flame.

* Laubscher [@Laubscher2017] compared the performance of a single-layer NN with 7 neurons and four
different combination of activation functions against DI and ISAT. His results were validated
against those available for the SANDIA D flame setup. Data for different time-step sizes
was generated using Python, Cantera, sciPy and numPy and then coupled with Fluent 17.0.
His report mentions accuracy comprable with traditional methods at decrease computational
cost.

* In 1996, Christo [@Christo1996] proposed a combined ANN/PDF approach, in which the later is used in
conjunction with DI simulations to create a training data-set. Earlier on the same year he
investigated the use of NN with a joint PDF transport equation for H2/CO2 turbulent jet
diffusion flames. He found that the benefits of ANN over traditional approaches are far
superior (in cost terms) when dealing with high-complexity mechanisms, but offer no
reward for those with less than three reactions.

* In 1998, Blasco et al. [@Blasco1998] delved into the use of ANN in laminar direct simulations,
modeling with them only the reaction mechanisms and not the whole flow. Their research
concluded that the ANN was well-suited for predicting the chemical species evolution
during the reaction, and reported a memory reduction with a factor of 831 when compared
to ISAT and a CPU time reduction of between 165-511. They also reported a correlation
between the size of the reaction time-step and the error between the ANN and the DI.
