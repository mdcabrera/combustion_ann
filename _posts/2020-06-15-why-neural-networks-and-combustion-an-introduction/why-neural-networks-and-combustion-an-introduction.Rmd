# Abstract:

The main objective of the work presented here is to research the current trends and advances
in the use of Artificial Neural Networks for the simulation of turbulent reactive flows using
Computational Fluid Dynamics in order to design, train and implement an efficient network capable
of predicting the chemical reaction source terms needed for the solveability of the Navier-Stokes
equations for a turbulent reactive flow. Unlike non-reacting flows, this type of simulations need to
be coupled with a combustion model, whose order of accuracy is linked with an increase in
complexity. Here, the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) is chosen as a combustion model, since it
offers an acceptable balance between accuracy and computational cost. Unfortunately, even at its
most optimal, this modeling of the turbulence-chemistry interaction remains still to cost-prohibitive
for but not the simplest of problems, as the current implementations for dealing with the resulting
system of ordinary differential equations incur on either large CPU or memory requirements. It is
hoped that once the source terms produced by the neural network are combined with a combustion
simulation based on the Eddy Dissipation Concept a decrease in computational resources is
achieved while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. A training data has to also be
generated, as well an experiment procedure, to test different combinations of parameters and
validate results.
