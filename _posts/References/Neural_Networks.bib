@article{Ranade2019,
abstract = {In this work, we demonstrate a framework for developing closure models in turbulent combustion using experimental multi-scalar measurements. The framework is based on the construction of conditional means and joint scalar PDFs from experimental data based on the parameterization of the composition space using principal component analysis (PCA). The resulting principal components (PCs) act as both conditioning variables and transported variables. Their chemical source terms are constructed starting from instantaneous temperature and species measurements using a variant of the pairwise mixing stirred reactor (PMSR) approach. A multi-dimensional kernel density estimation (KDE) approach is used to construct the joint PDFs in PC space. Convolutions of these joint PDFs with conditional means are used to determine the unconditional means for the closure terms: the mean PCs chemical source terms and the density. These means are parameterized in terms of the mean PCs using artificial neural networks (ANN). The framework is demonstrated a posteriori using the data from the Sandia piloted turbulent jet flames D, E and F by performing RANS calculations. The radial profiles of mean and RMS of temperature and measured species mass fractions agree well with the experimental means for these flames.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a novel data-based approach to turbulence modeling for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) by artificial neural networks. We define the perfect LES formulation including the discretization operators and derive the associated perfect closure terms. We then generate training data for these terms from direct numerical simulations of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We design and train artificial neural networks based on local convolution filters to predict the underlying unknown non-linear mapping from the coarse grid quantities to the closure terms without a priori assumptions. We show that selecting both the coarse grid primitive variables as well as the coarse grid LES operator as input features significantly improves training results. All investigated networks are able to generalize from the data and learn approximations with a cross correlation of up to 47{\%} and even 73{\%} for the inner elements, demonstrating that the perfect closure can indeed be learned from the provided coarse grid data. Since the learned closure terms are approximate, a direct application leads to stability issues. We show how to employ the artificial neural network output to construct stable and accurate models. The best results have been achieved with a data-informed, temporally and spatially adaptive eddy viscosity closure. While further investigations into the generalizability of the approach is warranted, this work thus represents a starting point for further research into data-driven, optimal turbulence models.},

In this publication, we apply the recently introduced, data-assisted method “recurrence CFD” (rCFD) to turbulent vortex shedding after a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=3900. Using a database of flow fields from short, conventional simulations, we time-extrapolate their behavior to arbitrary durations and obtain promising results for passive species transport with speed-up factors of more than 120 at 1/20 of the required computer power compared to the underlying large eddy simulation (LES). Besides this massive run-time reduction, we focus on data efficiency. For cases with strong, spatial scale separation, rCFD's resilience towards grid coarsening allows us to carry out calculations at lower mesh resolution provided one retains meso-scale velocity fluctuations as a contribution to diffusivity. This reduces database size which would otherwise become a bottleneck in the methodology.},

abstract = {Computational analysis of turbulent reactive flow applications requires resolution of the wide range of scales both in time and space from a flow modeling perspective. From a thermo-chemistry point of view, information regarding the radical chemical species is needed in order to capture flame-turbulence interactions accurately. A detailed investigation of all of these processes is time consuming. Thus, there is a need for speeding-up the computations by using the state-of-the art modeling capabilities. This study seeks to answer this problem and focuses in particular on the chemical kinetics calculations. The new approach proposed here is based on incorporating the artificial neural network (ANN) based modeling of the chemical kinetics into the large eddy simulation (LES) of reactive flows.    Two separate and new ANN based modeling approaches relevant to the LES are proposed within the thesis work. Here, the first approach depends on employing ANN to predict the species instantaneous reaction rates as a function of the thermochemical state vector ([special characters omitted] = ANN(Yk, T)). The second one is based on using ANN specifically to predict the spatially filtered chemical source terms in the LES modeling as a function of the filtered thermo-chemical state vector and flow quantities ([special characters omitted] = ANN(Y˜k,  T˜, Re$\Delta$, [special characters omitted])).    First part of the thesis work dealt with testing different thermo-chemical tabulation techniques that can be used in connection with the ANN approach for the LES. Basically, three distinct methods (and tools) are developed here: thermo-chemical tables based on (i) laminar flames, (ii) laminar flame-vortex interactions (FVI) and (iii) laminar flame-turbulence interactions (FTI). Results based on premixed flame-vortex-turbulence interaction simulations showed that the tables generated based on the second and third approaches are capable of representing the actual thermo-chemical state-space accessed by the LES.    Once the tabulation procedure and the ANN training is achieved, ANN is first validated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a temporally evolving planar jet flame, which is reported to exhibit complex extinction and re-ignition type of physics. The flame physics are also investigated for this flame, and it is observed that the scalar dissipation rate has a weak sensitivity to extinction and re-ignition, than it is reported in the literature. As a second test case, comparisons against experimental and previous computational data are provided for a practical combustor simulation. Overall for all simulations considered here, the results indicated that the ANN works as a combustion mode independent model and provides fairly accurate results with considerable amount of speed-up and memory savings.},

abstract = {In this work we propose a chemistry tabulation approach based on Rate-Controlled Constrained Equilibrium (RCCE) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and apply it to two non-premixed and non-piloted, CH4/H 2/N2 turbulent flames (DLR-A and DLR-B, with Re = 15,200 and 22,800, respectively). The objective of this approach is to train the ANNs with an abstract problem in such a way that endows them with the predictive power to capture the structure of a real turbulent flame. The training approach involves simulating an ensemble of laminar flamelets to generate training samples. Reduced chemistry is obtained via the application of RCCE to a detailed C/H/O/N mechanism employing 17 constraints. Regarding the training, testing and simulation of ANNs, we make use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) concept to perform pattern recognition tasks and predict the temporal evolution of the leading species. To evaluate the proposed methodology, the accuracy of RCCE-ANNs results is compared to a real time application of RCCE and experimental data in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) with a transported Probability Density Function (PDF) modelling of the combustion procedure. Comparison shows reasonable agreement with some discrepancies in the minor species, while a major speed-up of the chemical system integration is reported, indicating the potential of the RCCE-ANN tabulation methodology and ANN training approach for speeding up turbulent combustion computations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite-dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. For the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction. In this paper, we establish a new PDE interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning. Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall into two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.},

@article{Zimmer2015,
abstract = {The packaging of liquid products is conventionally realized by using two production stages, which are the stretch blow molding and the filling. In the stretch blow molding process, hot polyethylene terephthalate (PET) preforms are inflated by pressurized air into a cavity to form plastic bottles. In a follow-up process, these packages are filled by a separate machine with the desired liquid product. In contrast to that, liquid-forming combines the blowing and filling stages by directly using the liquid product to form a plastic bottle. Through this substitution, two main challenges arise. Firstly, there are significant inertia effects through the liquid mass, leading to additional reaction forces and a spatially inhomogeneous pressure distribution inside the preform. Secondly, the heat transfer between preform and fluid is drastically increased. Because of this cooling effect, a specific combination of forming speed as well as initial preform and liquid temperatures is necessary to avoid thermally induced preform rupture. This is based on the fact that the formability of PET rapidly declines below its glass transition temperature (Tg). Consequently, a process control requires the knowledge of how the process parameters influence the preform cooling. In this paper, a numerical simulation of the liquid-forming process (LF) is introduced including the preform cooling during forming. In addition, the strain-dependent self-heating effect of PET is implemented. Process experiments under different parameter combinations are conducted using simplified bottle geometry. Through a comparison of the results from experiments and from simulation, the influence of process parameters on the temperature drop and thus on thermally induced failure is determined. In this way, process understanding and control are increased.},

abstract = {We present an efficient deep learning technique for the model reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations for unsteady flow problems. The proposed technique relies on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the stochastic gradient descent method. Of particular interest is to predict the unsteady fluid forces for different bluff body shapes at low Reynolds number. The discrete convolution process with a nonlinear rectification is employed to approximate the mapping between the bluff-body shape and the fluid forces. The deep neural network is fed by the Euclidean distance function as the input and the target data generated by the full-order Navier-Stokes computations for primitive bluff body shapes. The convolutional networks are iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method with the momentum term to predict the fluid force coefficients of different geometries and the results are compared with the full-order computations. We attempt to provide a physical analogy of the stochastic gradient method with the momentum term with the simplified form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes momentum equation. We also construct a direct relationship between the CNN-based deep learning and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism for the model reduction of a fluid dynamical system. A systematic convergence and sensitivity study is performed to identify the effective dimensions of the deep-learned CNN process such as the convolution kernel size, the number of kernels and the convolution layers. Within the error threshold, the prediction based on our deep convolutional network has a speed-up nearly four orders of magnitude compared to the full-order results and consumes an insignificant fraction of computational resources. The proposed CNN-based approximation procedure has a profound impact on the parametric design of bluff bodies and the feedback control of separated flows.},

We then present two multi-step methods, recurrent ResNet (RT-ResNet) method and recursive ReNet (RS-ResNet) method. The RT-ResNet is a multi-step method on uniform time steps, whereas the RS-ResNet is an adaptive multi-step method using variable time steps. All three methods presented here are based on integral form of the underlying dynamical system. As a result, they do not require time derivative data for equation recovery and can cope with relatively coarsely distributed trajectory data. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the methods.},

Due to its importance, a variety of models of the blast furnace process have been developed in the past decades. In addition to this, a well-established analogue representation of blast furnace operation is given by the Rist operating diagram. The target of this work is to create a comprehensive blast furnace model in the simulation platform of gPROMS ModelBuilder{\textregistered}. Based on elemental assignments and empirical component distribution correlations, the blast furnace process is depicted by means of a black box model. The thermodynamic process boundaries are analysed in a Rist sub-model. Furthermore, an additional sub-model is used to calculate the adiabatic flame temperature in front of the blast furnace tuyeres. This modelling concept enables the description of interdependencies between the main blast furnace process, raceway conditions as well as overall thermodynamic process conditions within a single mathematical model. A detailed analysis of the model behaviour under varying coke substitution scenarios was carried out. The achieved simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the developed model for simulation of the blast furnace process under a wide range of operation conditions. The model also provides the means for simulation of different blast furnace route setups which allow for further optimisation regarding process efficiency, fuel consumption and environmental emissions of the blast furnace process.},

abstract = {The hard chromium plating process aims at creating a coating of hard and wear-resistant chromium with a thickness of some micrometres directly on the metal part without the insertion of copper or nickel layers. Chromium plating features high levels of hardness and resistance to wear and it is due to these properties that they can be applied in a huge range of sectors. Resistance to corrosion of a hard chromium plate depends on the thickness of its coating, and its adherence and micro-fissures. This micro-fissured structure is what provides the optimal hardness of the layers. The hard chromium plating process is one of the most effective ways of protecting the base material against a hostile environment or improving the surface properties of the base material. However, in the electroplating industry, electroplaters are faced with many problems and undesirable results with chromium plated materials. Common problems faced in the electroplating industry include matt deposition, milky white chromium deposition, rough or sandy chromium deposition and insufficient thickness and hardness. This article presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the thickness of the layer in a hard chromium plating process. The optimization of the ANN was performed by means of the design of experiments theory (DOE). In the present work the purpose of using DOE is twofold: to define the optimal experiments which maximize the ratio of the model accuracy, and to minimize the number of necessary experiments (ANN models trained and validated). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {For turbulent premixed flame surface, folded regions will be formed mainly depending on the turbulence-flame interaction and are significant structures which can increase flame surface area at large scale and enhance the local displacement speed. The conventional methods, such as PDF distribution of curvature, may not properly label the folded regions of turbulent flame because these regions intrude deeply into the products, resulting in a small curvature probability. This problem may be aggravated at elevated pressure and turbulence intensity conditions when more folded regions appear at the turbulent flame front. To identify the folded regions, Network topology of turbulent premixed flame front is constructed using the “visibility” method. Results show that this method can convert the spatial signal of turbulent flame to network topology, labeling the folded regions. Compared with curvature PDF, node degree distribution of network can reflect the mechanism of turbulence-flame interaction when the non-dimensional turbulence intensity is increased by different ways. The network structure of turbulent flame will transfer from sparse to condense when the dimensionless turbulence intensity is increased by pressure and perforated plate, as these two methods will extend the turbulence-flame interaction time and promote the interaction intensity, respectively. However, although the dimensionless turbulence intensity will increase with the augment of outlet velocity, the node degree distribution of network structure of turbulent flame front keeps almost constant. This is caused by the reduced turbulence-flame interaction time. It suggests that the turbulence-flame interaction time is an factor as important as the dimensionless turbulence intensity in turbulent premixed combustion. For forced-turbulent premixed flame at elevated turbulence intensity, the “bending phenomenon” will be hidden if the outlet velocity is not taken into account, as the outlet velocity is related to the turbulence-flame interaction time.},

A CNN inspired from a U-Net architecture is designed and trained on the DNS fields to estimate subgrid-scale wrinkling. It is then tested on an unsteady turbulent flame where the mean inlet velocity is increased for a short time and the flame must react to a varying turbulent incoming flow. The CNN is found to efficiently extract the topological nature of the flame and predict subgrid-scale wrinkling, outperforming classical algebraic models.},

abstract = {The efficacy of vapor-phase (VP) upland rice vinegar (URV) was investigated as a bio-fumigant for maize, to reduce consumer health risks associated with spore and toxin formation by Aspergillus flavus. Complete reduction of mycelial growth occurred with in vitro VP exposure to URV (containing 0.0017 mmol/L acetic acid) or with VP exposure to pure acetic acid (PAA) (containing 0.0023 mmol/L acetic acid). No significant differences were observed between the two materials after 90 min exposures. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), URV vapor was shown to contain volatiles having antifungal activities. These are identified as isoamylalcohol, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-, acetate and $\beta$-phenylethyl acetate. It is suggested these volatiles increase the antifungal effectiveness of URV. Exposure to VP-URV (containing 0.0043 mmol/L AA) for 5 h completely eliminated viable spores of A. flavus on maize seeds (23{\%} moisture content) previously inoculated with 4.43 ± 0.28 log spores/g). At the same time, aflatoxin production decreased, as VP-URV exposure increased. Hence, VP-URV is shown to be an effective control agent for A. flavus mycelial growth and aflatoxin formation on maize, so effectively reducing the potential for consumer health risks due to this widespread fungus.},

abstract = {The laminar flamelet concept is used in the prediction of mean reactive scalars in a non-premixed turbulent CH 4/H 2/N 2 flame. First, a databank for temperature and species concentrations is developed from the solutions of counter-flow diffusion flames. The effects of flow field on flamelets are considered by using mixture fraction and scalar dissipation rate. Turbulence-chemistry interactions are taken into account by integrating different quantities based on a presumed probability density function (PDF), to calculate the Favre-averaged values of scalars. Flamelet library is then generated. To interpolate in the generated library, one artificial neural network (ANN) is trained where the mean and variance of mixture fraction and the scalar dissipation rate are used as inputs, and species mean mass fractions and temperature are selected as outputs. The weights and biases of this ANN are implemented in a CFD flow solver code, to estimate mean values of the scalars. Results reveal that ANN yields good predictions and the computational time has decreased as compared to numerical integration for the estimation of mean thermo-chemical variables in the CFD code. Predicted thermo-chemical quantities are close to those from experimental measurements but some discrepancies exist, which are mainly due to the assumption of non-unity Lewis number in the calculations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

With this motivation in mind, this paper addresses: What are the problems encountered when modeling these interactions, or in other words, what are the problems of turbulent-combustion modeling? Do such interactions need modeling? What are the challenges when going from modeling low-speed- to high-speed-combustion problems? This work addresses these questions by summarizing several modeling studies of gaseous high-speed-combustion problems, and attempts to interpret some predictions in the context of the models' basic assumptions. Interestingly, the challenges to model high-speed combustion are such that a reader not interested in this topic but in the general one of modeling turbulent combustion may find the present paper useful.},

The use of artificial neural network (ANN) to represent chemical reaction in turbulent flames offers a significant reduction in the computer memory and run time demands over the classical methods, namely, look-up tables and direct integration. The adequacy of the neural network model strongly depends on the selection of the training set, which should be representative of the most accessible composition space. This is essential for the network to give an accurate model of the chemistry. A novel method known as statistical mapping is used to generate a training set for the neural network. This is a small-scale presimulation of the flame to produce a set of samples that are representative of the most accessible compositions during actual flame computations. In case of difficulties in achieving convergence of the network, "histogram redistribution" technique is used to smooth the PDF of the input samples. This technique is found to improve the convergence of network; however, its generality is yet to be determined.

GEF-H1 is a microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RhoA upon release from microtubules. The overexpression of GEF-H1 deficient in microtubule binding or treatment of HeLa cells with nocodazole to induce microtubule depolymerization results in Rho-dependent actin stress fiber formation and contractile cell morphology. However, whether GEF-H1 is required and sufficient to mediate nocodazole-induced contractility remains unclear. We establish here that siRNA-mediated depletion of GEF-H1 in HeLa cells prevents nocodazole-induced cell contraction. Furthermore, the nocodazole-induced activation of RhoA and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) that mediates phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) is impaired in GEF-H1–depleted cells. Conversely, RhoA activation and contractility are rescued by reintroduction of siRNA-resistant GEF-H1. Our studies reveal a critical role for a GEF-H1/RhoA/ROCK/MLC signaling pathway in mediating nocodazole-induced cell contractility.},

Flames with a range of fuel jet velocities and hence varying degrees of finite rate chemical kinetic effects have been calculated. The independent variables used are mixture fraction, $\xi$ and the specific molar abundance of three reactive scalars, $\Gamma$H2O, $\Gamma$CO2, and $\Gamma$H. Three multidimensional look-up tables are generated for density, other dependent properties and the composition increments due to chemical reaction. The use of these tables in all subsequent calculations is computationally efficient. Terms representing the effects of pressure fluctuations, mechanical dissipation, and scalar dissipation are modeled using an improved particle interaction model. Solutions are obtained on a Sun-Sparc1 station using 30 000 Monte Carlo particles for the low jet velocity flames and this number is increased to 50 000 at high jet velocities. The calculated velocity and turbulence fields as well as centerline velocity decay rates have not been compared with measurements but are consistent with recent experimental data collected in similar piloted jet flames of methane fuel. The calculated mixing field compares well with experimental data and the calculated flame length is slightly shorter than the observed visible flame length. For the low- and intermediate-velocity flames, the calculated temperature and mass fractions of the stable species agree reasonably well with instantaneous experimental data collected in similar flames. At high jet velocities, when the flames are close to blowoff and the finite rate chemical kinetic effects are very significant, discrepancies occur between measurements and computations and the blowoff jet velocity is underpredicted by about 20{\%}. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Many large scale problems in computational fluid dynamics such as uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inversion, data assimilation and PDE constrained optimization are considered very challenging computationally as they require a large number of expensive (forward) numerical solutions of the corresponding PDEs. We propose a machine learning algorithm, based on deep artificial neural networks, that predicts the underlying $\backslash$emph{\{}input parameters to observable{\}} map from a few training samples (computed realizations of this map). By a judicious combination of theoretical arguments and empirical observations, we find suitable network architectures and training hyperparameters that result in robust and efficient neural network approximations of the parameters to observable map. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate low prediction errors for the trained network networks, even when the network has been trained with a few samples, at a computational cost which is several orders of magnitude lower than the underlying PDE solver. Moreover, we combine the proposed deep learning algorithm with Monte Carlo (MC) and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute uncertainty propagation for nonlinear PDEs. Under the assumption that the underlying neural networks generalize well, we prove that the deep learning MC and QMC algorithms are guaranteed to be faster than the baseline (quasi-) Monte Carlo methods. Numerical experiments demonstrating one to two orders of magnitude speed up over baseline QMC and MC algorithms, for the intricate problem of computing probability distributions of the observable, are also presented.},

abstract = {Data from experiments and direct simulations of turbulence have historically been used to calibrate simple engineering models such as those based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. In the past few years, with the availability of large and diverse data sets, researchers have begun to explore methods to systematically inform turbulence models with data, with the goal of quantifying and reducing model uncertainties. This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed. A central perspective advocated in this review is that by exploiting foundational knowledge in turbulence modeling and physical constraints, researchers can use data-driven approaches to yield useful predictive models.},

The approach was based on employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that were designed, trained and incorporated into an existing LEM - LES numerical algorithm. Two numerical simulations of reacting flows have been carried out using several techniques for the estimation of the LES filtered reaction rate for the chemical species in laminar and turbulent, premixed, reactive flows, and the results were compared in terms of numerical accuracy and computational speed. It was concluded that the ANN approach provides a significant speedup of the numerical simulation while preserving acceptable accuracy. {\textcopyright} (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Microsatellite allelic states are determined by electrophoretic sizing of polymerase chain reaction fragments to define electromorphs. Numerous studies have documented that identical microsatellite electromorphs are potentially heterogeneous at the DNA sequence level, a phenomenon called electromorph size homoplasy. Few studies have examined the impact of electromorph size homoplasy on estimates of population genetic parameters. We investigated the frequency of microsatellite electromorph size homoplasy for 12 loci in the tropical tree Corythophora alta and 11 loci in the anadromous fish Morone saxatilis by sequencing 14-23 homozygotes per locus sampled from multiple populations for a total of 453 sequences. Sequencing revealed no homoplasy for M. saxatilis loci. Seven C. alta loci exhibited homoplasy, including single and compound repeat motifs both with and without interruptions. Between 12.5 and 42.9{\%} of electromorphs sampled per locus showed size homoplasy. Two methods of correction for homoplasy in C. alta generally produced little or no change in single-locus estimates of RST, except for two loci in which some additional differentiation among populations was revealed. Twelve-locus estimates of RST (including the seven loci corrected for homoplasy) were slightly greater than estimates from uncorrected data, although the 95{\%} confidence intervals overlapped. The frequency of methodological errors such as clerical mistakes or sample mislabelling per genotype scored was estimated at 5.4 and 7.3{\%} for C. alta and M. saxatilis, respectively. Simulations showed that the increase in RST produced by homoplasy correction was only slightly larger than variation in RST estimates expected to be caused by methodological errors.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application of experimental design for the optimization of artificial neural network (ANN) for the prediction of dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the Danube River. The aim of this research was to obtain a more reliable ANN model that uses fewer monitoring records, by simultaneous optimization of the following model parameters: number of monitoring sites, number of historical monitoring data (expressed in years), and number of input water quality parameters used. Box–Behnken three-factor at three levels experimental design was applied for simultaneous spatial, temporal, and input variables optimization of the ANN model. The prediction of DO was performed using a feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN), while the selection of most important inputs was done off-model using multi-filter approach that combines a chi-square ranking in the first step with a correlation-based elimination in the second step. The contour plots of absolute and relative error response surfaces were utilized to determine the optimal values of design factors. From the contour plots, two BPNN models that cover entire Danube flow through Serbia are proposed: an upstream model (BPNN-UP) that covers 8 monitoring sites prior to Belgrade and uses 12 inputs measured in the 7-year period and a downstream model (BPNN-DOWN) which covers 9 monitoring sites and uses 11 input parameters measured in the 6-year period. The main difference between the two models is that BPNN-UP utilizes inputs such as BOD, P, and PO43−, which is in accordance with the fact that this model covers northern part of Serbia (Vojvodina Autonomous Province) which is well-known for agricultural production and extensive use of fertilizers. Both models have shown very good agreement between measured and predicted DO (with R2 ≥ 0.86) and demonstrated that they can effectively forecast DO content in the Danube River.},

abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have led to breakthrough results in numerous practical machine learning tasks, such as classification of images in the ImageNet data set, control-policy-learning to play Atari games or the board game Go, and image captioning. Many of these applications first perform feature extraction and then feed the results thereof into a classifier. The mathematical analysis of DCNNs for feature extraction was initiated by Mallat, 2012. Specifically, Mallat considered so-called scattering networks based on a wavelet transform followed by the modulus non-linearity in each network layer, and proved translation invariance (asymptotically in the wavelet scale parameter) and deformation stability of the corresponding feature extractor. This paper complements Mallat's results by developing a theory that encompasses general convolutional transforms, or in more technical parlance, general semi-discrete frames (including Weyl-Heisenberg filters, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets, wavelets, and learned filters), general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities (e.g., rectified linear units, shifted logistic sigmoids, hyperbolic tangents, and modulus functions), and general Lipschitz-continuous pooling operators emulating, e.g., sub-sampling and averaging. In addition, all of these elements can be different in different network layers. For the resulting feature extractor, we prove a translation invariance result of vertical nature in the sense of the features becoming progressively more translation-invariant with increasing network depth, and we establish deformation sensitivity bounds that apply to signal classes such as, e.g., band-limited functions, cartoon functions, and Lipschitz functions.},

The agreement of calculated statistics against those measured by Laufer ranges from good to marginal. The eddy shapes are examined, and only the u-component, longitudinal eddies are found to be elongated in the downstream direction. However, the lateral v eddies have distinct downstream tilts. The turbulence energy balance is examined, including the separate effects of vertical diffusion of pressure and local kinetic energy.

abstract = {The challenge of the mathematical modelling is to transfer basic physical knowledge into a mathematical formulation such that this knowledge can be utilized in computational simulation of practical problems. The combustion phenomena can be subdivided into a large set of interconnected phenomena like flow, turbulence, thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, radiation, extinction, ignition etc. Combustion in one application differs from combustion in another area by the relative importance of the various phenomena. The difference in fuel, geometry and operational conditions often causes the differences. The computer offers the opportunity to treat the individual phenomena and their interactions by models with wide operational domains. The relative magnitude of the various phenomena therefore becomes the consequence of operational conditions and geometry and need not to be specified on the basis of experience for the given problem. In mathematical modelling of turbulent combustion, one of the big challenges is how to treat the interaction between the chemical reactions and the fluid flow i.e. the turbulence. Different scientists adhere to different concepts like the laminar flamelet approach, the pdf approach or the Eddy Dissipation Concept. Each of these approaches offers different opportunities and problems. The merits of the models can only be judged by their ability to reproduce physical reality and consequences of operational and geometric conditions in a combustion system. The present paper demonstrates and discusses the development of a coherent combustion technology for energy conversion and safety based on the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) by Magnussen. It includes a complete review of the concept and its physical basis. Some modifications of the concept in relation to previous publications are included and discussed. These modifications do not alter the computational results but hopefully clarifies the EDC concept to the readers.},

abstract = {The Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) is common in modeling turbulent combustion. Several model improvements have been proposed in literature; recent modifications aim to extend its validity to Moderate or Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) conditions. In general, the EDC divides a fluid into a reacting and a non-reacting part. The reacting part is modeled as perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) or plug flow reactor (PFR). EDC theory suggests PSR treatment, while PFR treatment provides numerical advantages. Literature lacks a thorough evaluation of the consequences of employing the PFR fine structure treatment. Therefore, these consequences were evaluated by employing tests to isolate the effects of the EDC variations and fine structure treatment and by conducting a Sandia Flame D modeling study. Species concentration as well as EDC species consumption/production rates were evaluated. The isolated tests revealed an influence of the EDC improvements on the EDC rates, which is prominent at low shares of the reacting fluid. In contrast, PSR and PFR differences increase at large fine fraction shares. The modeling study revealed significant differences in the EDC rates of intermediate species. Summarizing, the PFR fine structure treatment might be chosen for schematic investigations, but for detailed investigations a careful evaluation is necessary.},

abstract = {The blast furnace (BF) hearth's condition is crucial for a long and healthy campaign life. Previous numerical investigations on BF drainage commonly treated the deadman as a static, porous medium. In this work, we employ a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) – discrete element method (DEM) to account for its dynamic behavior. The model is utilized in several short-term simulations to generate a database of deadman states based on iron and slag levels, coke properties and the burden weight distribution. In contrast to the previous Eulerian deadman descriptions, we directly obtain an inhomogeneous description of the porosity from a particle size distribution. The database is utilized in the dynamic void fraction model, to describe the transient deadman in a fully Eulerian framework for long-term simulations. In essence, we present a strategy to mitigate the coupling between the dynamics of a packed bed and the fluid flow through it by connecting the bed's evolution to global state parameters such as the levels of liquids in which the particles float. This methodology is not restricted to blast furnaces, but can also be applied to other problems involving slow granular motion with dynamic interstitial fluids. The model is first validated with experiments of water drainage through a lab-scale, particle-filled tank, and is shown to give similar results as CFD–DEM for both sitting and floating particle beds. We then demonstrate our model's advantages and necessity on isothermal simulations of a full-scale BF hearth for various deadman setups. We further highlight the effects of a coke free region due to a floating deadman as well as an almost impermeable dense center on the flow. Finally, by comparing simulations of a dynamic and a fixed floating deadman, we show that the dynamic behavior significantly affects the iron and slag drainage rate, which results in a 20 min extended duration after 120 min tapping. To conclude, we present a highly performing approach to study the behavior of fluid flow through moving granular beds without costly contact detection but with information obtained from previous DEM simulations.},

abstract = {Background Clinicians performing orotracheal intubation need to be competent to perform this technical skill safely. It is recognized that aggressive force applied during direct laryngoscopy may damage the oropharyngeal soft tissue; however, force is seldom considered in assessment of competency. The objective of this study was to explore the force applied during orotracheal intubation as a method of further discriminating between levels of competence. We sought evidence of construct validity in the form of discriminant, criterion, and concurrent validity. We hypothesized that the force generated during simulated intubation could serve to discriminate skill level among clinicians. Methods A convenience sample of 35 health-care professionals filled a self-reported questionnaire and were then divided into the following three groups: Group 1, experts (n=16); Group 2, intermediates (n=7); and Group 3, novices (n=12). They then intubated a part-task trainer (Laerdal Airway Management Trainer) after reviewing a procedural video and engaging in one practice session. Intubations were recorded. Outcome measures were as follows: (i) force applied to the epiglottis, calculated (in newtons) using two superimposed pressure-sensitive films (Prescale; Fujifilm, Madison, WI, USA) on the laryngoscope blade; (ii) number of attempts required to achieve successful intubation; (iii) time to intubation; and (iv) hand position. Results Of the four outcome measures, only force applied during orotracheal intubation was able to discriminate between groups. All data are reported as the mean (sd). There was a significant difference in force between groups during orotracheal intubation [one-way anova; experts, 102 (25) N; intermediates, 134 (28) N; and novices, 153 (43) N], with a significant difference (P{\textless}0.05) noted between novice and experts on post hoc analysis. Conclusions Force exerted during intubation provides meaningful information when attempting to discriminate intubation skill level. Force demonstrated criterion validity and could be used as a measure of competency during training.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 The Author.},

Our seven scenarios, evaluating visual data analysis and reasoning, evaluating user performance, evaluating user experience, evaluating environments and work practices, evaluating communication through visualization, evaluating visualization algorithms, and evaluating collaborative data analysis were derived through an extensive literature review of over 800 visualization publications. These scenarios distinguish different study goals and types of research questions and are illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios, we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. Scenarios can be used to choose appropriate research questions and goals and the provided examples can be consulted for guidance on how to design one's own study. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Prieler2018,
abstract = {In the present study a transient heating process in a natural gas fired test furnace, used for fire resistance tests of construction and building materials, was investigated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To ensure the reproducibility of a fire resistance test, the thermal exposure of the tested fire safety material has to be homogeneous and, thus, the temperature distribution is of high importance. For that purpose, a CFD-based optimization of the transient heating process was carried out using different optimization algorithms. Based on the furnace setup, parameters with a potential to improve the temperature distribution were identified and used for the optimization procedure. CFD results were used to create system response surfaces, which represent the temperature distribution in the furnace as a function of the chosen design parameters. The system response was approximated by neural networks and genetic algorithms, and represents the basis for the optimization. Since the duration of the transient process was 35 min, the calculation time of the gas phase combustion and heat transfer is high. Therefore, a novel CFD-based approach was used to investigate and improve the process by converting the transient heating problem to steady-state cases. A comparison of the initial and the optimized furnace configuration showed an improved temperature distribution, where the maximum temperature difference in the furnace at the measurement position was decreased from approx. 200 K to 162 K. This approach showed that the transient simulation can be optimized, and further used for other applications where a transient simulation is computationally too demanding.},

@article{Sen2009,
abstract = {The applicability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach as a chemistry integrator for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of reactive flows is evaluated with special emphasis on generating training tables independent of the computation of interest. An ANN code based on back-propagation algorithm is developed with a new approach for self-determining the model coefficients adaptively with respect to the error surface topology. The training table is constructed with an independent flame study, and the trained networks are used in LES of turbulent Flame-Vortex Interaction (FVI) studies at different equivalence ratios and turbulence levels. It is shown that once the ANN is well trained, it can successfully predict the reaction rates in both memory and time efficient manner compared to traditional look-up table approach and stiff ODE solvers, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Combustion Institute.

@article{Cohn1996,
abstract = {I consider the question 'How should one act when the only goal is to learn as much as possible?'. Building on the theoretical results of Fedorov (1972, Theory of Optimal Experiments, Academic Press) and MacKay (1992, Neural Computation, 4, 590-604), I apply techniques from optimal experiment design (OED) to guide the query/action selection of a neural network learner. I demonstrate that these techniques allow the learner to minimize its generalization error by exploring its domain efficiently and completely. I conclude that, while not a panacea, OED-based query/action selection has much to offer, especially in domains where its high computational costs can be tolerated.},

@article{Yang2019,
abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a major tool in understanding and predicting the behavior of reacting flows, which intrinsically involve the complex interaction of chemical kinetics and fluid mechanics. Among various open source CFD packages, the widely used C++ finite volume simulation toolbox OpenFOAM has many advantages such as its object-orientated framework, convenience to add multiphysics module and free availability, however, many weaknesses have been identified regarding its application in chemically reacting flows, especially incomplete splitting schemes, poor ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers for stiff chemistry and the oversimplified mixture transport models, etc. In this work, an OpenFOAM 5.0 based reacting flow CFD platform reactingFoam-SCI is constructed by further implementing a few state-of-the-art advances in computational combustion, including a robust midpoint operator splitting scheme, and an accurate stable stiff ODE solver with error control. An interface between OpenFOAM 5.0 and the open source package Cantera 2.3.0 is also developed, to allow the evaluation of multicomponent and mixture-averaged transport properties and the call of other Cantera subroutines. The effectiveness and robustness of this new platform have been systematically validated against the analytical solutions and literature reported direct numerical calculation results, including those from a diffusion-convection problem, homogeneous ignition delay, shock tube, one-dimensional spherical flame initiation and propagation, two-dimensional unsteady premixed flame subject to hydrodynamic and diffusional-thermal instabilities, one-dimensional non-premixed counterflow flame and two-dimensional non-premixed co-flow flame. The satisfactory agreement demonstrates the accuracy and robustness of the current platform.},

This project takes a novel approach to solving the Navier-Stokes Equations for turbulence by training a neural network using Bayesian Cluster and SOM neighbor weighting to map ionospheric velocity fields based on 3-dimensional inputs. Parameters used in this problem included the velocity, Reynold's number, Prandtl number, and temperature. In this project data was obtained from Johns-Hopkins University to train the neural network using MATLAB. The neural network was able to map the velocity fields within a 67{\%} accuracy of the validation data used. Further studies will focus on higher accuracy and solving further non-linear differential equations using convolutional neural networks.},
